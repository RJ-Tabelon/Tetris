# Tetris Overview
Tetris is a classic tile-matching puzzle video game where players manipulate falling geometric shapes, called tetrominoes, to create complete horizontal lines within a rectangular playfield. Each tetromino is composed of four connected squares arranged in different configurations, and players must rotate and position them as they descend to prevent the stack from reaching the top. Successfully completing a line causes it to disappear, earning points and creating more room for new pieces.
